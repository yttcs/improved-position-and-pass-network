## Plotting pass networks with expected threat (xT) of passes per position.

### We do three things in this notebook

plot pass netwrok based on average player positions when passing.
plot improved pass network based on KDE (centroid/peak) of player positions when passing + color code each position based on xT of passing per position
plot team position based on KDE area of player positions when passing.
