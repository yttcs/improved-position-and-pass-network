## Plotting pass networks with expected threat (xT) of passes per position.

### We do three things in this notebook

1. plot pass network based on average player positions when passing.
2. plot team position based on KDE area of player positions when passing.
3. plot improved pass network based on KDE (centroid/peak) of player positions when passing + color code each 
   position based on xT of passing per position.
